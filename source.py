# In All Plots: Time period of all plots is Jan 2009 to Dec 2019
# 
# In Plot 1: The cost of oil per barrel in US Dollars (USD) is shown and how the price has changed
# In Plot 2 and 3: The exchange rate at the end of the specified month is shown for USD to Japanese Yen (JPY)[Plot 2] and USD to Euros (EUR)[Plot 3]
# In Plot 4: Cost of standard grocery items are shown by month

# After looking through the data, there are no missing values nor outlying values, therefore no data cleaning was needed for the project
