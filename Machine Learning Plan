Machine Learning will be Supervised ML
I don't anticipate any major issues within the ML itself but rather comparisons to real-life values
There's not much that can be done to address this since the cause of the potential issue was unprecedented (a global pandemic)

Implementation Process:

Visualize all data to look for any discrepancies or missing data, using averages for the year to fill in missing data
Split training sets in a 75/25 split for each year of the specified decade
Clean data using sci-kit
Categorical data will be X value as the only categorical data is month/year
I would expect that Linear Regression will be the best for the data, but will try a number of options

Feedback:
No major feedback or changes, PowerBI file is only for reference
